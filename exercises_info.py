        "leg_press":
''' 
1. Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).
2. Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position.
3. As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.
4. Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale.
5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.

*Caution*: Always check to make sure that when you re-rack the weight the platform is securely locked.

        "front_squat":        
'''
The front squat builds exactly on the mechanics of the air squat. All that is added is a load supported in the front-rack position, where the weight sits squarely on the upper chest and shoulders, and the elbows point forward to bring the upper arms parallel to the floor. This “rack position,” critical to weightlifting, both demands and improves wrist and shoulder flexibility while the load, supported by the torso, both demands and improves midline stability.

*The Set-up*
Start with the bar secure in the squat rack, level with the middle of your chest. Hold the bar with hands just wider than shoulder-width apart. Step in close to the bar and lower into a quarter squat so the bar is level and touching the top of your chest and front of your shoulders. Without letting go of the bar, bring your elbows forwards and up as high as you can manage. Focus on keeping your elbows as high as possible throughout the squat – this will keep your body upright and the bar secure in the crook of your hands and resting against your chest and shoulders. Drive up to take the bar out of the rack.

*The Move*
Take one step backwards. Position your feet shoulder-width apart, with your toes pointing very slightly diagonally away from each other. Brace yourself, take a deep breath in to fill your chest and keep your torso strong, then bend your legs to lower into a squat. Keep your knees wide apart and heels down. Lower until your legs are at least parallel with the floor, then drive back up to stand.

        "forward_lunge":
'''
1. Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Engage core.
2. Take a big step forward with right leg and start to shift weight forward so heel hits the floor first.
3. Lower body until right thigh is parallel to floor and right shin is vertical (it's okay if knee shifts forward a little as long as it doesn't go past right toe). If mobility allows, lightly tap left knee to ground while keeping weight in right heel.
4. Press into right heel to drive back up to starting position.
5. Repeat on the other side.

*Muscles Targeted by the Forward Lunge*
Primarily your quadriceps and glutes, but also your hamstrings, calves, and core.
Lunges can help you develop lower-body strength and endurance, and unlike squats, they are highly effective at evening out muscle imbalances. 

*How to Make the Forward Lunge Easier*
Perform the move using only your bodyweight, don’t descend quite as far toward the floor, or perform a rear lunge, stepping back into the move instead of forward.
 
*How to Make the Forward Lunge Harder*
Use heavier weights and/or hold the bottom position for longer.
You can also try variations, including walking and lateral lunges, as well as the lunge row twist.

        "wide-stance_barbell_squat":
'''
1. Begin by loading the bar appropriately and stepping under it, placing it across the back of the shoulders slightly below the rear deltoids in a â€œlow-barâ€ position. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders.
2. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet in a wider-than-shoulder-width stance with the toes slightly pointed out and knees slightly bent. Keep your neck neutral. This will be your starting position.
3. Descend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt backwards. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
4. Descend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt backwards. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
5. Drive up through your heels, pushing your feet and knees out. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe, until you have returned to the starting position.
6. Repeat for recommended amount of repetitions.

        "stiff-legged_barbell_deadlift":
'''
1. Grasp a bar using an overhand grip (palms facing down). You may need some wrist wraps if using a significant amount of weight.
2. Stand with your torso straight and your legs spaced using a shoulder width or narrower stance. The knees should be slightly bent. This is your starting position.
3. Keeping the knees stationary, lower the barbell to over the top of your feet by bending at the waist while keeping your back straight. Keep moving forward as if you were going to pick something from the floor until you feel a stretch on the hamstrings. Inhale as you perform this movement.
4. Start bringing your torso up straight again by extending your hips until you are back at the starting position. Exhale as you perform this movement.
5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

*Caution*: This is not an exercise that is recommended for people with lower back problems. Also, it needs to be treated with the utmost respect paying special attention not to round the back forward as you move the torso down; the back should always be straight. Finally, jerking motions or doing too much weight can injure your back.
''',
        "hack_squat": 
'''
1. Stand up straight while holding a barbell behind you at arms length and your feet at shoulder width. Tip: A shoulder width grip is best with the palms of your hands facing back. You can use wrist wraps for this exercise for a better grip. This will be your starting position.
2. While keeping your head and eyes up and back straight, squat until your upper thighs are parallel to the floor. Breathe in as you slowly go down.
3. Pressing mainly with the heel of the foot and squeezing the thighs, go back up as you breathe out.
4. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

*Variations*: This exercise can also be performed with your heels slightly elevated on a small block. This is a good option for beginners who lack the flexibility to perform the exercise without it.
''',
        "low_bar_squat":
'''
Every squat variant utilizes some inclination of the torso with respect to the ground. In the low bar squat, leaning over is fundamental to the movement. It is not a form fault. Instead, it is desirable–an expression of good technique that allows you to meet the criteria above.
To squat a weighted barbell safely, you must be in balance. The center of mass of the barbell and your body’s center of mass must be directly in line with your balance point–the middle of the foot.
If you move the bar down the back so that it sits in the shelf formed between the contracted posterior deltoids and spines of the scapulae, this will affect what you do to stay in balance. To keep the bar over the middle of the foot, you will need to lean over as you descend.
How much you lean over depends upon the relative lengths of your torso, thigh, and lower leg to one another. These relationships, called anthropometry, and how much forward lean is required will vary from lifter to lifter.
If you move the bar about two inches up the back so that it sits on top of the trapezius, as is done with the high bar squat, the amount you need to lean over is less than before. Further, if you move the bar in front of the neck so that it rests on the anterior deltoids, as is done in the front squat, the torso angle is more vertical yet. You cannot lean over very far in a heavy front squat, or you will dump the bar on the ground.
''',
        "barbell__deadlift":
'''
1. Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. Your feet should be about hip-width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder-width allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an alternating grip.
2. With your feet and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and flex the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head. Keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward.
3. After the bar passes the knees aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar.
4. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.

        "good_morning":
'''
*Benefits"
When done with solid spinal alignment and perfect form, the good morning can be a great move for improving your back health. It strengthens your lower-back muscles and core while helping to lightly stretch and bolster your hamstrings, making it a money move for office workers, weightlifters, sportsmen and marathon runners alike.

*Safety*
The way to reap the benefits and avoid doing yourself a mischief is to keep the movement slow, the form strict and the weight light. It’s even worth performing the exercise without weight or just with a resistance band at first. Make sure you get the form consistently perfect right through the set before progressing to using a barbell with plates – that way you shouldn’t strain your back.

*Steps*
1. Begin with a bar on a rack at shoulder height. Rack the bar across the rear of your shoulders as you would a power squat, not on top of your shoulders. Keep your back tight, shoulder blades pinched together, and your knees slightly bent. Step back from the rack.
2. Begin by bending at the hips, moving them back as you bend over to near parallel. Keep your back arched and your cervical spine in proper alignment.
3. Reverse the motion by extending through the hips with your glutes and hamstrings. Continue until you have returned to the starting position.

        "calf_press_on_leg_press_machine":
'''
1. Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance.
2. Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you without locking your knees. (Note: In some leg press units you can leave the safety bars on for increased safety. If your leg press unit allows for this, then this is the preferred method of performing the exercise.) Your torso and the legs should make perfect 90-degree angle. Now carefully place your toes and balls of your feet on the lower portion of the platform with the heels extending off. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position.
3. Press on the platform by raising your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.
4. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.
5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

*Caution*: Be very cautious as you place the feet in the bottom part of the platform as if you slip and the safety bars are not locked then you could suffer a serious accident.

*Variations*: You can perform this exercise one leg at a time.

        "standing_calf_raises":
'''
1. Adjust the padded lever of the calf raise machine to fit your height.
2. Place your shoulders under the pads provided and position your toes facing forward (or using any of the two other positions described at the beginning of the chapter). The balls of your feet should be secured on top of the calf block with the heels extending off it. Push the lever up by extending your hips and knees until your torso is standing erect. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position.
3. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.
4. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.
5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

*Caution*: If you suffer from lower back problems, a better exercise is the calf press as during a standing calf raise the back has to support the weight being lifted. Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury.

*Variations*: There are several other ways to perform a standing calf raise. A barbell instead of a machine can be used instead as well as dumbbells, one leg or two legs at a time. Refer to the exercise descriptions of these movements below. A smith machine can be used for calf raises as well.

        "squat_leg_raise":
'''
To do the Squat with Leg Raise, start standing tall with your feet about hip-width to shoulder-width apart. Then squat down, sitting your butt back while keeping your chest up. Make sure your heels stay on the ground and that your first move is to sit back. Squat as low as you can then drive back up to standing.
At the top, shift your weight on to one leg and lift the other leg up and out to the side. You can use a little momentum to lift but feel the outside of your glute working to lift your leg to the side. You may also lean slightly but don’t turn it into a move where you are completely bent to the side at the waist. Try to stay as tall as possible as you lift. Also, do not rotate the leg open as you lift just to try to lift up higher.
Then squat back down before performing a leg raise to the other side.
''',
        "squat_knee_raise":
'''
*Form*
1. Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, elbows bent, and arms held before chest.
2. Flex your knees, sitting back with hips, until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Make sure your knees follow the direction of the toes.
3. As you come up, shift your weight onto the outside of your sole. Lift up one knee as high as you can, tighten the glute on the other side, and twist your upper body towards the raised knee.
4. Switch opposite sides with the same motion.

*Breathing*
Breathe in when squatting, breathe out when standing up.

*Tips*
Take it in a consistent pace.
While standing up, feel the contraction in your glutes and quads

        "seated_calf_raise":
'''
1. Sit on the machine and place your toes on the lower portion of the platform provided with the heels extending off. Choose the toe positioning of your choice (forward, in, or out) as per the beginning of this chapter.
2. Place your lower thighs under the lever pad, which will need to be adjusted according to the height of your thighs. Now place your hands on top of the lever pad in order to prevent it from slipping forward.
3. Lift the lever slightly by pushing your heels up and release the safety bar. This will be your starting position.
4. Slowly lower your heels by bending at the ankles until the calves are fully stretched. Inhale as you perform this movement.
5. Raise the heels by extending the ankles as high as possible as you contract the calves and breathe out. Hold the top contraction for a second.
6. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

        "reverse_calf_raise":
'''
1. Adjust the barbell on the smith machine to fit your height and align a raised platform right under the bar.
2. Stand on the platform with the heels of your feet secured on top of it with the balls of your feet extending off it. Position your toes facing forward with a shoulder width stance.
3. Now, place your shoulders under the barbell while maintaining the foot positioning described and push the barbell up by extending your hips and knees until your torso is standing erect. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. Tip: The barbell on your back is only for balance purposes.
4. Raise the balls of your feet as you breathe out by extending your toes as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position for a second before you start to go back down.
5. Slowly go back down to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering the balls of your feet and toes.
6. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

*Variations*: You can also have someone place a dumbbell in between your feet for resistance. You can also perform this exercise using a doorstep and you can use the sides of the door frame for balance.

If you change the position of the platform by putting it forward or backwards, it will emphasize the higher or lower calf. Similarly, the stance you use can affect where it hits; the closer your feet are, the more the sides will be isolated, whereas the further apart your feet are, the more the front tibialis will be targeted.

        "glute_kickback":
'''
1. Kneel on the floor or an exercise mat and bend at the waist with your arms extended in front of you (perpendicular to the torso) in order to get into a kneeling push-up position but with the arms spaced at shoulder width. Your head should be looking forward and the bend of the knees should create a 90-degree angle between the hamstrings and the calves. This will be your starting position.
2. As you exhale, lift up your right leg until the hamstrings are in line with the back while maintaining the 90-degree angle bend. Contract the glutes throughout this movement and hold the contraction at the top for a second. Tip: At the end of the movement the upper leg should be parallel to the floor while the calf should be perpendicular to it.
3. Go back to the initial position as you inhale and now repeat with the left leg.
4. Continue to alternate legs until all of the recommended repetitions have been performed.

*Variations*: For this exercise you can also perform all of the repetitions with one leg first and then the other one. Additionally, you can also add ankle weights.

        "one-legged_cable_kickback":
'''
1. Hook a leather ankle cuff to a low cable pulley and then attach the cuff to your ankle.
2. Face the weight stack from a distance of about two feet, grasping the steel frame for support.
3. While keeping your knees and hips bent slightly and your abs tight, contract your glutes to slowly kick the working leg back in a semicircular arc as high as it will comfortably go as you breathe out. Tip: At full extension, squeeze your glutes for a second in order to achieve a peak contraction.
4. Now slowly bring your working leg forward, resisting the pull of the cable until you reach the starting position.
5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
6. Switch legs and repeat the movement for the other side.

*Variations*: You can perform this exercise with exercise bands.

        "pelvic_lift":
'''
You can lay on a firm bed, exercise mat, or the floor if it's comfortable. When you perform a pelvic tilt from this position, you're essentially taking the natural curve out of your lower back. It can help to visualize your pelvis as a bowl of water; when you tilt your pelvis, imagine water spilling toward your belly.

1. Lie on your back with bent knees and the soles of your feet on the floor. In this neutral position, the natural curve of your lumbar spine will lift the lower back slightly off the floor.
2. Exhale and gently rock your hips toward your head. As you do this, you'll feel your lower back pressing into the floor.
3. Stay here for a few breaths. When you're ready, inhale and return to your neutral position.

*Safety and Precautions*
With so many variations and modifications, pelvic tilts are safe for most people.
You may want to avoid supine pelvic tilts if you're pregnant or have a condition that makes it painful to be flat on your back.
While standing and kneeling pelvic tilts can be a little more of a challenge, they're a better option for people who are pregnant or unable to lie on their back.
If you have balance problems or injuries to your knees or feet that do permit weight-bearing, you should avoid standing pelvic tilts until you're healed.

        "heel_beats":
'''
Lie on your stomach with your forehead on your hands. Have your legs together, straight behind you.

1. Lift your abdominal muscles away from the mat. Feel your spine lengthen.
2. Turn your legs out very slightly at the hip, with heels together.
3. Lift your legs off the mat. Keep your abs lifted and legs together as you send lengthening energy down the backs of your legs and through your heels.
4. Beat your heels together and apart quickly as your legs stay lifted. Though the exercise is called heel beats, the emphasis is on working from the inner and back of the upper thigh.

        "pull-up":
'''
1. Grab the pullup bar with your palms down (shoulder-width grip)
2. Hang to the pullup-bar with straight arms and your legs off the floor
3. Pull yourself up by pulling your elbows down to the floor
4. Go all the way up until your chin passes the be bar
5. Lower yourself until your arms are straight

*Tips and Notes*:
Keep the movement slow and controlled at all times. 
Ensure the body is tight throughout the exercise and keep the torso straight. 
Minimise 'kipping', rocking or swaying movements for strict pull-ups. 
Pull-ups can be performed on a static bar or gymnastic rings. Using gymnastics rings for pull-ups allows the joints to track naturally due to the free rotation of the rings. Many people find rings a more preferable platform for pull-up exercises. See ring pull-up exercise for further details. 
One effective mental tip to help with pull-ups that many people find helpful is to envisage yourself pulling the bar down to your chest, as opposed to hoisting your body to the bar.
Don't start your next rep until you've fully extended your arms. Anything else and you're just cheating yourself for rep numbers. Full range of motion is harder but builds incredible strength.

        "chin-up":
'''
1. Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing your torso and a grip closer than the shoulder width.
2. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, keep your torso as straight as possible while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. Tip: Keeping the torso as straight as possible maximizes biceps stimulation while minimizing back involvement.
3. As you breathe out, pull your torso up until your head is around the level of the pull-up bar. Concentrate on using the biceps muscles in order to perform the movement. Keep the elbows close to your body. Tip: The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.
4. After a second of squeezing the biceps in the contracted position, slowly lower your torso back to the starting position; when your arms are fully extended. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.
5. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

*Variations*:
If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a pull-up assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.
Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.
On the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.

        "bent_over_barbell_row":
'''
1. Holding a barbell with a pronated grip (palms facing down), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.
2. Now, while keeping the torso stationary, breathe out and lift the barbell to you. Keep the elbows close to the body and only use the forearms to hold the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause.
3. Then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

*Caution*: This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.
Also, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.
Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.

*Variations*: You can perform the same exercise using a supinated (palms facing you) grip.

        "barbell_shrug":
'''
1. Stand up straight with your feet at shoulder width as you hold a barbell with both hands in front of you using a pronated grip (palms facing the thighs). Tip: Your hands should be a little wider than shoulder width apart. You can use wrist wraps for this exercise for a better grip. This will be your starting position.
2. Raise your shoulders up as far as you can go as you breathe out and hold the contraction for a second. Tip: Refrain from trying to lift the barbell by using your biceps.
3. Slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.
4. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

*Variations*: You can also rotate your shoulders as you go up, going in a semicircular motion from front to rear. However this version is not good for people with shoulder problems. In addition, this exercise can be performed with the barbell behind the back, with dumbbells by the side, a smith machine or with a shrug machine.

1. Place a dumbbell standing up on a flat bench.
2. Ensuring that the dumbbell stays securely placed at the top of the bench, lie perpendicular to the bench (torso across it as in forming a cross) with only your shoulders lying on the surface. Hips should be below the bench and legs bent with feet firmly on the floor. The head will be off the bench as well.
3. Grasp the dumbbell with both hands and hold it straight over your chest at arms length. Both palms should be pressing against the underside one of the sides of the dumbbell. This will be your starting position. *Caution*: Always ensure that the dumbbell used for this exercise is secure. Using a dumbbell with loose plates can result in the dumbbell falling apart and falling on your face.
4. While keeping your arms straight, lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head while breathing in until you feel a stretch on the chest.
5. At that point, bring the dumbbell back to the starting position using the arc through which the weight was lowered and exhale as you perform this movement.
6. Hold the weight on the initial position for a second and repeat the motion for the prescribed number of repetitions.

*Caution*: If you are new to this movement, have a spotter hand you the weight instead. If not, please ensure that the dumbbell does not fall on you as you arrange your torso to perform the exercise on the bench. Also, as I already mentioned, ensure that the dumbbell used is in perfect working condition. Old dumbbells in need of welding should never be used to perform this exercise.

*Variations*:
You can perform this exercise using a barbell or an e-z bar instead of dumbbells
Also, if using dumbbells like Powerblocksâ„¢, just use a dumbbell on each hand with the palms of your hands facing each other.

'''
1. Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down with a dumbbell on each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
2. Once you are laying down, move the dumbbells in front of you at shoulder width. The palms of the hands should be facing each other and the arms should be perpendicular to the floor and fully extended. This will be your starting position.
3. With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.
4. Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.
5. Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

*Variation*: You may want to use a palms facing forward version for different stimulation.

        "handstand_push-up":
'''
1. With your back to the wall bend at the waist and place both hands on the floor at shoulder width.
2. Kick yourself up against the wall with your arms straight. Your body should be upside down with the arms and legs fully extended. Keep your whole body as straight as possible. Tip: If doing this for the first time, have a spotter help you. Also, make sure that you keep facing the wall with your head, rather than looking down.
3. Slowly lower yourself to the ground as you inhale until your head almost touches the floor. Tip: It is of utmost importance that you come down slow in order to avoid head injury.
4. Push yourself back up slowly as you exhale until your elbows are nearly locked.
5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

*Caution*: Ensure that the floor surface is not slippery and also, if performing for the first time, use a spotter until you get good at this exercise.

        "high_incline_bench_press":
'''
1. Lean back on an incline bench at about 30 to 45 degrees. Your feet need flat on the floor giving yourself a good sturdy base. Lower back is flat against the bench. Arch your back slightly during this lift. Take hold of the bar with a medium-wide grip. When you have the bar off the rack, do not start down immediately with it. Raise the bar off the rack and hold it right above your head arms locked. Like with the bench press, hold it at the top for just a second and get oriented.
2. Start down with the weight slowly, touch the muscles directly underneath the point that the clavicles meet; basically the upper chest or top of the chin. Pause for a brief moment so you don't bounce the weight off your chest, then press it back up to the top position, exhaling on the way up. Do not touch the nipple area, this is way too low.
3. Bar placement should be as stated, either touch your chin, or just below your clavical. Even going an inch too low takes the emphasis off the target area. Keep your wrists straight and your elbows beneath your wrists with your arms tucked at a 45-degree angle. Do not keep your elbows back this puts maximum stretch on the pecs and serious stress on the shoulder joint.

        "dips_triceps_version":
'''
1. To get into the starting position, hold your body at arm's length with your arms nearly locked above the bars.
2. Now, inhale and slowly lower yourself downward. Your torso should remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your body. This helps to better focus on tricep involvement. Lower yourself until there is a 90 degree angle formed between the upper arm and forearm.
3. Then, exhale and push your torso back up using your triceps to bring your body back to the starting position.
4. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

*Variations*: If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a dip assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.
Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.

More advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.

1. Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
2. From the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest.
3. After a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.
4. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
5. When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.

*Caution*:
If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.
Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to touch your middle chest and nowhere else.
Don't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.

1. Sit down on a flat bench with one dumbbell in front of you between your legs. Your legs should be spread with your knees bent and feet on the floor.
2. Use your right arm to pick the dumbbell up. Place the back of your right upper arm on the top of your inner right thigh. Rotate the palm of your hand until it is facing forward away from your thigh. Tip: Your arm should be extended and the dumbbell should be above the floor. This will be your starting position.
3. While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Tip: At the top of the movement make sure that the little finger of your arm is higher than your thumb. This guarantees a good contraction. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.
4. Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting position as your breathe in. Caution: Avoid swinging motions at any time.
5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Then repeat the movement with the left arm.

*Variations*: This exercise can be performed standing with the torso bent forward and the arm in front of you. In this case, no leg support is used for the back of your arm so you will need to make extra effort to ensure no movement of the upper arm. This is a more challenging version of the exercise and is not recommended for people with lower back issues.
